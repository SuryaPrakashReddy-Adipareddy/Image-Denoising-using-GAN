Title: Image Denoising using GAN

Introduction:

Image denoising is a crucial task in computer vision, aiming to remove unwanted noise from images to enhance their quality and improve subsequent processing tasks. Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) have emerged as powerful tools for various image generation and enhancement tasks, including image denoising.

GANs consist of two neural networks, namely the generator and the discriminator, which are trained simultaneously in a competitive manner. The generator learns to generate realistic images, while the discriminator learns to distinguish between real and generated images. Through adversarial training, GANs can effectively capture the underlying distribution of clean images and generate corresponding denoised versions.

In this repository, we present an implementation of image denoising using GANs, where the generator is trained to produce clean versions of noisy images, while the discriminator learns to distinguish between noisy and denoised images. By leveraging the adversarial training process, our model learns to effectively remove noise while preserving essential features in the input images.
